This project implements a String Calculator based on the popular TDD. It allows you to add comma-separated numbers, new line-separated numbers, and even numbers with custom delimiters. Additionally, it supports a user interface for interactive calculation.

## Features

Basic Addition: Add comma-separated or new line-separated numbers.

Custom Delimiters: Use a custom delimiter by specifying it at the beginning of the string.

Negative Number Handling: Throws an exception for negative numbers.

User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for interactive calculation (Frontend specific).
